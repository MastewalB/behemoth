# Email verification plugin

This document explains how `plugins/emailverification` works: how it finds out that a user needs a link without any sign-up code calling it, how its send and verify flows run, and why its sends never wait for the mail sender. It builds on the same pieces as the magic link plugin, and [`magiclink.md`](magiclink.md) explains those that are shared: the link that points at the application, the POST verify, the token's subject, the trusted-origin check and what a route hides.

The code lives in `plugins/emailverification/`: `emailverification.go` has the verification itself, and `change.go` the flow for changing an address, which the second half of this document covers.

## What the plugin contributes

| `types.Plugin` method | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `Meta` | name `emailverification`, no dependencies, no mount path |
| `Declare` | the `email_verification` token kind (single use, `Options.TTL`, database backend), six hook points, three rate-limit rules |
| `Register` | handlers on three user data points, and with `RequireVerified` on `auth.signIn.credentialsVerified` |
| `Init` | checks the options and the mailer, parses `LinkURL`, wraps the two flows with `types.WithLifecycle` |
| `Routes` | `POST /email/send-verification`, `POST /email/verify` |

It is the first plugin that registers handlers. The email/password and magic link plugins only fire points.

## How it hears about users

The plugin has no dependency on a sign-up plugin, and no sign-up plugin calls it. It registers on the store's data points, which fire for every write to `users` whatever caused it.

| Point | Tier | Handler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data.user.created` | after commit | `sendTo(user)`: send a link if the user is unverified |
| `data.user.beforeUpdate` | in the transaction | if the update changes the address: set `email_verified` to false unless the update sets it, and leave a note in `Values` |
| `data.user.updated` | after commit | if the note is there: `sendTo(user)` |
| `auth.signIn.credentialsVerified` | flow | with `RequireVerified`: refuse an unverified user |

Compare the alternatives: a call from each sign-up plugin would make each of them know this one, and an OAuth plugin written later would have to remember it. A handler on `auth.signUp.after` would miss users created by a CLI or by a plugin that does not fire that point.

### The change of address

These two handlers are the fallback for a write that changes the address directly. They keep `EmailVerified` true to its name. They don't keep the old address until the new one confirms; that is the change flow's job (below), and the flow's own writes pass through them untouched.

An update's payload holds only the columns being changed, so the handler on `data.user.beforeUpdate` has to read the current row to tell a change from a rewrite of the same value:

1. No `email` key in the changes: return. This is the common case, and it costs nothing.
2. Read the user through `hctx.Tx`, with the id from `Values[HookValueUserID]`. The read is in the write's transaction.
3. Compare the normalized addresses. Equal: return.
4. If the changes don't set `email_verified`, set it to false. An update that sets it is left alone.
5. Set `Values["emailverification.emailChanged"]`.

`data.user.updated` shares the update's `Values`, so its handler sees the note and sends the link once the transaction has committed. The send has to wait for the commit: a link for an address the database then rolls back would confirm nothing.

- **The plugin's own update does not trigger it.** `Verify` updates `email_verified` only, so step 1 returns.
- **The magic link plugin's update does not either**, for the same reason.

### After-commit sends are best effort

Both sends run in after-commit handlers. An error there is logged by the dispatcher and the write stands. That is the wanted behaviour: a user should not fail to sign up because a link could not be issued. The send route is the user's way to ask again.

## Sending a link

`sendVerification` resolves a request by user id before the flow, publishes the email in `Values` for the rate-limit rule, and calls the flow wrapped with `auth.emailVerification.beforeSend`, `.afterSend` and `.sendFailed`. `sendBody`:

| Step | What | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | check the email's shape and the redirect URL (`types.TrustedRedirect`) | a validation error |
| 2 | find the user by email, unless the request came with one | not found: `Fail` with `userNotFound`, return `ErrNoAccount` |
| 3 | the user is verified already | return `ErrAlreadyVerified`; no point fires |
| 4 | `RevokeAllForSubject(email_verification, user.ID)`, then `Issue` with `{email, redirectURL}` | `Fail` with `issueFailed` |
| 5 | `ac.Mailer.SendAsync(ctx, MailMessage{Kind: MailEmailVerification, ...})` | the message was not queued: revoke the token, `Fail` with `sendFailed` |
| 6 | return a `*SendResult`; `WithLifecycle` fires `.afterSend` | |

- **Step 5 does not wait.** `afterSend` means the message was queued, not delivered. A send that fails later is logged by the mailer.
- **A handler can't change who the link goes to.** `SendRequest.FromMap` reads the redirect URL and the metadata back from the payload and ignores `email` once the request is in the flow.
- **The route hides steps 2 to 5**, as the magic link route does: `ErrNoAccount`, `ErrAlreadyVerified` and an `afterLookupError` all become the `200` of a sent link.

## Verifying a link

`Verify` reads the token without consuming it, for the redirect URL and the email in the before payload, then runs `verifyBody` wrapped with `.beforeVerify`, `.afterVerify` and `.verifyFailed`:

1. `Consume` the token. A rejection is `invalidLink`.
2. Find the user by the token's subject. Gone: `userNotFound`.
3. Compare the email in the token's metadata with the user's. Different: `emailChanged`.
4. Set `email_verified` with `Store.UpdateUser`, unless it is set already.

Every refusal answers with one typed unauthorized error, `invalid_verification_link`. No session is created.

## Design decisions

### A plugin of its own
**Context:** Email verification could live in the email/password plugin as an option, in core, or in a plugin.
**Options considered:**
- *An option of the email/password plugin.* One plugin to install for the common case. An application that signs users in by OAuth or magic link only would load the password plugin to verify an address.
- *Core.* Always there. Core has no routes and composes no messages.
- *A plugin that listens to user writes.* Works with every way of creating a user. One more plugin to pass to `Prepare`.
**Decision:** A plugin. What it verifies is a column of the core `users` table, and nothing about it involves a password.

### Sends are always in the background
**Context:** The send is triggered by other operations: a sign-up, a profile update. The mailer offers `Send`, which waits, and `SendAsync`.
**Options considered:**
- *Wait.* A failure is known at once. Every sign-up waits for the mail provider, inside an after-commit handler that runs synchronously.
- *An option, as in the magic link plugin.* Flexible. There is no case here where waiting buys anything.
- *Never wait.* A failure is only logged.
**Decision:** Never wait. The operation is idempotent: a lost message costs the user a retry, a new link replaces the old one, and a request for a verified address does nothing. The magic link plugin differs because it acts on a failed send by revoking the link.
**Revisit if:** applications want the send to fail a sign-up. That would also need the send to run before the commit.

### A direct write of a new address takes effect at once
**Context:** When a write changes a user's address without going through the change flow, the handlers have to do something with it.
**Options considered:**
- *Replace and mark unverified.* The flag stays honest. The unconfirmed address is the account's identifier at once.
- *Refuse the write.* Forces everything through the change flow. An admin screen or an import could no longer set an address.
**Decision:** Replace and mark unverified. The handlers are a net under writes the plugin does not control, and the safe path is `RequestChange`. `docs/ongoing.md` has an entry on refusing such writes when the flow is on.

### `RequireVerified` hooks `auth.signIn.credentialsVerified`
**Context:** A sign-in of an unverified user has to be refused somewhere.
**Options considered:**
- *`auth.signIn.before`.* Earliest. The payload differs by sign-in method and has no user, and refusing before the password is checked tells anyone whether an address is verified.
- *`auth.signIn.credentialsVerified`.* It has the user id whatever the method, and runs after the credentials were accepted.
**Decision:** `credentialsVerified`. The sign-in flows report the refusal as `secondFactorRejected` in the audit event, which is the name they give any veto at that point.

## The email change flow

`change.go` adds a flow in which the new address has to confirm before it replaces the old one, and the old address is told and can undo it. It is off unless `Options.ChangeLinkURL` and `RevertLinkURL` are set; `Declare`, `Init` and `Routes` each check `changeEnabled()`.

| Declared when on | Value |
| --- | --- |
| token kinds | `email_change` (to the new address, `ChangeTTL`) and `email_change_revert` (to the old address, `RevertTTL`); both single use, database backend, subject the user's id |
| hook points | `auth.emailChange.` `beforeRequest`, `afterRequest`, `requestFailed`; `beforeConfirm`, `afterConfirm`, `confirmFailed`; `beforeRevert`, `afterRevert`, `revertFailed`. After and failed are audited |
| route rules | 10 a minute per client address on each of the three routes |
| hook rule | `emailverification.change.user` on `beforeRequest`: `Options.ChangeLimit` per `HookValueUserID` |

No table or column holds the pending change. The two addresses travel in the tokens' metadata:

| Token | Metadata | Read by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `email_change` | `from` (the address the user had), `to` (the one asked for), `redirectURL` | `changeConfirmBody` |
| `email_change_revert` | `restore` (the address the user had) | `changeRevertBody` |

### Request

`RequestChange` publishes the user's id in `Values` and runs `changeRequestBody`:

| Step | What | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | check the new address's shape, the redirect URL, and that it differs from the current address | a validation error |
| 2 | `RevokeAllForSubject(email_change, user)`: a new request replaces the pending one | `Fail` with `issueFailed` |
| 3 | issue the revert token and `Mailer.Send` the notice to the current address | revoke the token, `Fail` with `noticeFailed` |
| 4 | look for another user with the new address | found: `Fail` with `emailTaken`, return `ErrEmailTaken` |
| 5 | issue the change token and `Mailer.SendAsync` the confirmation to the new address | revoke the token, `Fail` with `sendFailed` |

- **Nothing in `users` changes.**
- **Revert tokens are never revoked when a new one is issued.** Each belongs to its request. Why is under *The older revert link wins*.
- **Step 4 comes after the notice.** A request for a taken address then does the same work as one for a free address up to the last step, and the route answers both with the same `200`.
- **The new address is not reserved.** Step 4 is a courtesy check. The confirm finds out for real, from the unique constraint.

### Confirm

`ConfirmChange` reads the token without consuming it (`readChangeToken`: the user for `Values`, the address for the payload, the redirect URL for the result), then `changeConfirmBody`:

1. `Consume` the token. A rejection is `invalidLink`.
2. Find the user. Gone: `userNotFound`.
3. The user's address has to be the token's `from`. If not, a revert or another change came first: `emailChanged`.
4. `Store.UpdateUser` with `email` and `email_verified: true` in one write. A duplicate-key error is `emailTaken`, answered with a `409`.

Step 4 goes through the plugin's own fallback handlers. `data.user.beforeUpdate` sees an update that sets the flag and leaves it alone. `data.user.updated` finds the note and a verified user, and sends nothing.

### Revert

`changeRevertBody`, after consuming the token and finding the user:

1. `RevokeAllForSubject(email_change, user)`: a pending change is dropped.
2. `ListForSubject(email_change_revert, user)`, and revoke every token that was not created before this one.
3. If the user's address is not `restore`, write `email: restore` and `email_verified: true`. A duplicate-key error is remembered and not returned yet.
4. `SessionManager.RevokeAllForUser` with the reason `email_change_reverted`.
5. If step 3 hit a duplicate key: `Fail` with `emailTaken` and return the `409`.

The same link therefore cancels a change that is pending and undoes one that was applied. Steps 1, 2 and 4 run in both cases.

### What the flow needed from core

| Addition | Where | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TokenManager.ListForSubject(kind, subject)` | `types/token.go`, `transport/token.go`, `Store.ListTokensForSubject` | step 2 of the revert revokes some of a user's revert tokens and not all. It returns the usable tokens of a kind, oldest first; a key-value kind can't be listed |
| `SessionManager.IsFresh(session)` and `types.RequireFreshSession` | `types/session.go`, `transport/session.go` | `SessionConfig.FreshAge` and `Session.FreshAt` existed and nothing read them. A session is fresh when it is active and `FreshAt` is within `FreshAge` (`DefaultFreshAge`, 15 minutes, when zero). `FreshAt` is set by `Create` and `Promote` |
| `MailMessage.Data`, two mail kinds | `types/mail.go` | the notice has to name the new address, which nothing else on the message carries |

`RequireFreshSession` wraps `RequireSession` and then checks `IsFresh`. A stale session gets a typed session error, `session_not_fresh`, which maps to `401`.

### Design decisions

#### The pending change lives in token metadata
**Context:** Between the request and the confirm, the new address has to be kept somewhere.
**Options considered:**
- *A `pending_email` column on `users`.* Visible in the row, easy to show in a settings page. A schema change for every application, and a second place that has to agree with the token.
- *The token's metadata.* No schema change. The pending address expires with the token and is removed with the user. Showing "a change is pending" needs `ListForSubject`.
**Decision:** The metadata. The token already is the pending change: it has the lifetime, the single use and the revocation.
**Revisit if:** applications need to query pending changes across users.

#### One link at the old address, issued at the request
**Context:** The old address has to be able to stop a change it did not ask for.
**Options considered:**
- *A notice without a link.* The owner learns of it and can do nothing.
- *A cancel link that works until the confirm.* Someone who took over a session confirms from their own mailbox within seconds, so the link is nearly always too late.
- *Approval from the old address before the change.* The strongest. A user who lost the old mailbox, which is a common reason to change, can't change at all.
- *A link that works before and after the confirm, for some days.* It drops a pending change and undoes an applied one. The old mailbox keeps a say over the account for that long.
**Decision:** The fourth, sent when the change is requested and not when it is applied, so the owner hears of an attempt as early as possible. `RevertTTL` is 72 hours by default.
**Revisit if:** the window proves too long for users who change address because the old mailbox is compromised. A shorter default, or an option to send the notice without a link, would cover that.

#### The older revert link wins
**Context:** After two changes, `a@` to `b@` to `c@`, two revert links exist: one at `a@` that restores `a@`, one at `b@` that restores `b@`. If someone took the account over at the first change, `b@` is theirs.
**Options considered:**
- *A new request revokes the earlier revert links.* One live link per user, as for the other tokens. Whoever took the account over makes a second request and the owner's link is dead.
- *Using a revert link revokes all the others.* The holder of `b@` uses their link first and kills the owner's.
- *Links never affect each other.* The owner restores `a@`, and the holder of `b@` then uses their link to put `b@` back.
- *Using a link revokes the links issued after it.* A link can cancel later ones and never earlier ones.
**Decision:** The fourth. The address that held the account earliest has the last word, in whatever order the links are used. It needs to revoke a subset of a subject's tokens, which is what `ListForSubject` was added for. The comparison is "not created before" and not "created after", because some databases store the creation time to the second.

#### The notice waits, the confirmation does not
**Context:** The mailer offers `Send`, which waits and returns the sender's error, and `SendAsync`.
**Decision:** `Send` for the notice: the request fails if the notice can't be handed over, and no confirmation link is issued. The notice is the owner's safeguard, so a change does not start without it. `SendAsync` for the confirmation, like a verification link: if it is lost the user asks again.
**Revisit if:** the wait bothers applications whose sender is slow. They can give a sender that enqueues.

#### The request needs a fresh session
**Context:** The request route acts for the session's user.
**Options considered:**
- *Any valid session.* A session left open on a shared computer, or stolen, is enough to move the account.
- *The password again in the request.* Certain. It ties the plugin to the password plugin, and a user who signs in by magic link has none.
- *A fresh session.* Works for every sign-in method. A user whose session is older signs in again.
**Decision:** A fresh session, with `RequireFreshSession`. It is the use `FreshAge` was put in `SessionConfig` for.
**Revisit if:** a way to re-check credentials on an existing session is added. The user would then not have to sign in again.
